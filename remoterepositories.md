# Working with Remote Repositories in Git

## Setting a Remote Repository
- **Command:** `git remote add origin [URL]`
- **Usage:** This command is used to link your local repository to a remote repository.
- **Details:**
  - Replace `[URL]` with the URL of your remote repository.
  - `origin` is a shorthand name for your remote repository.

## Pushing Changes to a Remote Repository
- **Command:** `git push`
- **Usage:** This command uploads your local repository content to a remote repository.
- **Details:**
  - To push your current branch and set the remote as upstream, use `git push -u origin master`.
  - Replace `master` with your branch name if you are working on a different branch.

## Fetching Changes from a Remote Repository
- **Command:** `git fetch`
- **Usage:** This command downloads changes from a remote repository but doesn't integrate these changes into your local repository.
- **Details:**
  - Use `git fetch origin` to fetch changes from the remote repository named `origin`.

## Pulling Changes from a Remote Repository
- **Command:** `git pull`
- **Usage:** This command fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into your local repository.
- **Details:**
  - Use `git pull origin master` to pull changes from the `master` branch of the `origin` remote.
  - Replace `master` with another branch name as needed.

## Other Relevant Remote Repository Commands and Practices
- **Inspecting a Remote Repository:** Use `git remote -v` to view the remote repositories connected to your local repository.
